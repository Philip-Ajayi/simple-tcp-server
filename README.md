# simple-tcp-server
This is a simple TCP server that can be used to demonstrate basic TCP communication. The server listens on a specified port and accepts incoming connections. When a client connects, the server creates a new thread to handle the connection. The server thread receives data from the client, checks for malicious code, and then sends a response.
